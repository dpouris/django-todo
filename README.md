### A basic to-do app made with Django in which you can add/complete and remove items from.

All the to-do items are stored in a database and you can see the date they were created.

There's is also a theme swapper (just for fun I guess🤷‍♂️).

I stole something from github as well, try to find what I stole😏.

In order to run it execute the following commands on your git bash.

**NOTE: Choose the right directory to clone the repo into**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JimPouris/django-todo.git
```

After that go into the directory in which you clone the repo and on your command prompt type:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

And you're done! Enjoy😃

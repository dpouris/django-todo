### A basic to-do app made with Django in which you can add/complete and remove items from.

All the to-do items are stored in a database and you can see the date they were created.

There's is also a theme swapper (just for fun I guessü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

I stole something from github as well, try to find what I stoleüòè.
